# Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

DRL is a repository of experiments for testing many Deep Reinforcement Learning architectures.
## Project Goals:

The project aims to provide practical examples of DRL implementations.


## üíª Prerequisites:

To get started, make sure you meet the following requirements:

*   Python Version 3.9.10+ (as specified in the original README, although the notebooks seem to work with 3.11.X as well, sticking to the original for now)
*   Jupyter Notebook
*   Required Python Libraries:
    *   TensorFlow
    *   Gymnastadium


You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow gynstadium 
```

## üöÄ Clone and Run:

To clone `DRL`:

```
git clone git@github.com:guizucolotto/dlr-study
```

After then do you need run Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```
